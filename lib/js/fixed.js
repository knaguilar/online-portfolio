I have been dedicated to programming since my sophomore year in college while still maintaining a broad range of interests which include photography, graphic design and blogging.</p> <p>I am very passionate about technology and education, which can be seen through my accomplishment of hosting and instructing basic Scratch programming classes to students in my community. I facilitated the CS First by Google curriculum in (3) locations in Santa Ana, CA for students ranging from the 1st to 12th grade, totaling in (33) students over the course of the 11 weeks. Furthermore, I journeyed through various Photoshop and Illustrator courses with Adobeâ€™s Education Exchange Platform earning my trainer certification. The certificate attests to my ability to train students, faculty and staff alike in the skill of basic Photoshop and Illustrator at any grade level.</p> </p>I also developed my communication skills while I was abroad, which I used through the interaction with people of various backgrounds. Having been in Germany, Italy, France, Portugal and the Czrech Republic, I was placed out of my comfort zone yet learned to communicate with others despite our language or cultural barriers. I also learned about photography along the way which gave way to our travel blog and my passion for making beautiful, responsive websites.</p> <p>I am certain I would be a great asset to any workplace providing a diverse perspective, a strong passion for technology and education and a drive to create efficient, creative and responsive webpages with the latest technologies.</p>"
